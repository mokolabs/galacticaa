					<description>I am extremely disappointed in the level of completeness of the windows xp set. The graphic quality of them doesn't come close to the other sets I've downloaded from this site, and more than one of the icons were half blackened out. The BSG 75 icon wasnt even readable and the ships were all too small to even notice on my desktop. I'm sorry for this bad news, but I know that you can do mutch better than that.</description>
