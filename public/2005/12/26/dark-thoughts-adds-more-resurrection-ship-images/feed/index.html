					<description>Yeah, I'm inclined to agree with you both. I guess the possibility of an Adama/Roslin relationship is exciting, but it's probably something Moore will only flirt with.</description>

					<description>Moore's smart; like everything in the show, I think he's going to give us a strong hint of what could be between Adama and Roslin but leave us without enough, keeping it a mystery.</description>

					<description>Personally, I'm really happy to see something happen between Adama and Roslin.



Of course, if it's anything more than the Apollo/Starbuck accidental kiss, then we'll have probably have to deal with the ethical issues that arise from having the Colonials' two most important leaders in love with each other.



But when have things ever been easy on Galactica?</description>
