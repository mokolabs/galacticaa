					<description>Nice widget.  The image was lifted from our site at http://www.kropserkel.com/cylon.htm and the watermarks removed.  Needless to say, without being asked, we weren't too thrilled about the credit for it being nabbed by Tasty Buffalo Design (who are ignoring our requests BTW).



I am the Cylon in that image and it was for a commercial on Sci-Fi for the return airing of the original series.</description>
