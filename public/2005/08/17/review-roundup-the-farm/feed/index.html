					<description>Hey, thanks for the links. It's impossible to search for BSG-related stuff on lj based on having &quot;battlestar galactica&quot; as an interest. There are 100+ communities with the interest, many of which seem to be slashfic--somehow, I have no interest in that--and in a group of more than 50 users with the interest (there are ~500) it's too time-consuming to try to find any worth reading.</description>
