					<description>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh, this is what the Cylons see? That kinda sucks. BSG just jumped the shark.Ã¢â‚¬Â



Those are my fears exactly.  It was my biggest pet peeve about X-Files; they were great at sucking us into the conspiracy plots, but the reveal at the end was invariably disappointing.



Sometimes we like our mysteries unsolved. :)</description>

					<description>Heh... I was wondering if it was the scene where Starbuck interrogates Leoben. Is it me, or in the shot where he overturns the table, is that her stunt double shot dead on from the front? Either that isn't Katee, or she suddenly switched faces, because she doesn't look anything like herself. If I'm right, that was a poor choice of camera angles.</description>
