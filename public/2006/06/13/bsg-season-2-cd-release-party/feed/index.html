					<description>Thank you so much for this.  I was there (the middle-aged black woman with the cane... I was the only one of those in the crowd  :) but I was so overwhelmed by it all that I couldn't share much coherency to my peeps on LiveJournal.  I've pointed them here (after myself being pointed here by the beautiful kelinea).  Your pictures are just beautiful, and I so envy you those autographs.  My husband made us leave before the end.  I'm seriously thinking about divorce...</description>
