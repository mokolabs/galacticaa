					<description>I attended and this comic con panel in San Diego

the music that was previewed.. the BSG season 2 CD was outstanding, Celtic opera with Japenese overtones.... if you get a chance grab one!.

Bear is an incredibly talented man...his music vibrates and his very powerful even without the BSG video background...........

Kevin Grazier, who talked briefly about the new BSG, is a very knowledgeable enthusiastic sci-fi nut who will keep you smiling for at least a week..........nerds rule....his own words

check out EUREKA he is also the sci-tech for that new show.

Brad Linaweaver...a very interesting writer and person..him I would love to catch him at an airport with an hour or so to spare....

Blam Ventures; Drew Gaska was also present ...Drew gave an update on the new artist and progress of the up coming Great War of Magelan Comics due out next year.....along with the graphic novel and other related works.

All in all Richard was a gracious host to audience and panel...fielding  the questions and letting the Music and new BSG videos rock the  hall.........it wasn't until the end .... he showed the SECOND COMING to those who had not seen it  before....it still gives me goose bumps.....sigh ... I only wish it became a reality.</description>
