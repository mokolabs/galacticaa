					<description>I've downloaded the 2.1 widget and am getting no countdown, no info on next episode and it doesn't retain the start time of the show. I'm running Mac OSX 10.4.6. Is there something I'm missing, or is this the surprise? ;0)</description>

					<description>Thanks for the comments, everyone.



Stephanie -- looks like you found the first official widget bug! I'll fix this and release a new version in a few days.



crashdown -- the widget isn't resizeable, but you shouldn't need to ever resize it.</description>
