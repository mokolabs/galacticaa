					<description>This is what we play at home:



Take a sip whenever someone says Frak.

Take a sip whenever Tighe takes a drink.

Take a sip whenever Starbuck takes a drink.



Take a big gulp whenever the Doctor is shown smoking.

Take a big gulp whenever Starbuck is shown smoking.

Take a big gulp whenever someone throws a punch at a card game.



Chugalug (finish your drink) whenever someone throws a punch at a superior officer.

Chugalug whenever a new cylon model is revealed

Whenever the Command Bridge bursts into relieved applause.</description>

					<description>Those are hilarious, Javier.



Let me see if I can add a few...



When someone calls a Cylon a &quot;toaster&quot; - 1 drink

When you hear the Dradis sound - 1 drink

When Baltar and Six have a dream sequence at Baltar's house back on Caprica - 3 drinks

When a character is covered in a ridiculous amount of blood (Apollo post-Adama's shooting, Starbuck's &quot;blood beard&quot; on Caprica, etc.) -- 3 drinks

When a character introduces a new &quot;frak&quot; curse word (&quot;Frak's sake&quot;,&quot;motherfrakker&quot;, etc.) -- 3 drinks

When there's a gratuitous shot of Apollo in the buff - 4 drinks

When Starbuck sits on the Arrow of Apollo - 4 drinks

When Six talks *without* using her sexy/sultry voice - 4 drinks

When there's a blog post by Ron Moore - 5 drinks

When they finally find Earth - Open bar!</description>

					<description>Well I just spent a little while coming up with this:



When somebody says Ã¢â‚¬Å“frakÃ¢â‚¬Â 1 drink

Whenever anything goes tragically/horribly wrong 2 drinks

Whenever Six comes on 1 drink

Whenever Tigh or his wife drinks 1 drink

Whenever Adama looks unhappy/pissed/upset 2 drinks

Whenever Dualla gets a phone call 2 drinks

Whenever Apollo gets nearly naked or shirtless 4 drinks

Whenever Boomer tries to prove sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really nice and not evil 4 drinks

Whenever Helo looks like heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking Ã¢â‚¬Å“What the frak have I gotten myself into?Ã¢â‚¬Â 1 drink

Whenever Roslin disagrees with anyone about anything 2 drinks

Whenever Starbuck either has to do something other than flying or hits somebody 4 drinks

Whenever Tyrol gets angry at one of his deck hands 2 drinks

Whenever Baltar does something wrong i.e. morally apprehensible 1 drink

If Cally kills someone else (other than Boomer) 4 drinks

Whenever someone dies 1 drink

Whenever someone important dies or gets wounded unexpectedly ( e.g. Boomer, Adama etc.) 5 drinks, cÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mon they died itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you wanna drink

If the camera does that panning-zooming thingy 2 drinks

If Raiders appear 2 drinks

If a Basestar appears 3

If someone says anything pertaining to religion 2 drinks

And just cause I like Starbuck

If Starbuck kicks ass in a dogfight or otherwise does anything insane at any time 3 drinks



Have fun! :)</description>

					<description>Well, there's my version too: take a drink whenever Number Six appears. I can't think of anything else. I think we'll have to brainstorm on this one. ;)</description>
