					<description>I love the fact he always has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth while he is working on people! Seems like a gruff old field medic who has been a military doctor for 40 years.</description>

					<description>No doctor can be forced to do something they find unethical - we might be applying reality a bit much to something that is fiction - but Doctors are bound by the limitations of good conscience to act in the best interests of their patients.  He was not bound to do what he did, especially in inflicting emotional harm on both Sharon and Helo.  He made a choice. And that choice had to consider that both Sharon and her baby were not entirely human.</description>

					<description>I love Doc Cottle myself... he's a crusty old coot, but he's one of my favourite characters. And Donnelly Rhodes plays him to a 'T'. 



Oh and to Scar: Cottle was pressed into serving his president and doing an icky thing he greatly disliked... but have you forgotten that Doc is MAJOR Cottle. He's a soldier underneath those medical whites mate...</description>

					<description>Has she forgotten that the good doctor collaborated with the president and Adama to hide her baby.  You can't deny the moral implications of such a decision.  Making it, in fact shows that he certainly does take sides.  Simply bandaging up skin jobs doesn't put him in the realm of neutrality.  He's doing what any honorable battlefield doctor would do.  That's a long way from sitting it out.</description>
