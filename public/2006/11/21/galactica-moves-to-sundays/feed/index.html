					<description>I believe that the move is a good thing.  I'm feel the people who watch BSG have the kind of loyalty as those who watch 24 religiously.  Moving to Sunday wont detract from this kind of audience but it will give the show a chance to expand to those who don't watch it simply because it is on Friday night.  As far as TV movies and even the big screen, I think that this BSG might want to stick to its origins which have given it so much success, namely the show itself and the miniseries that began it.  Moving to the big screen after a successful run has proven fatal to so many other shows.  As far as an endgame, the show doesn't really need to go beyond the realm it has created.  They have so much freedom with a weekly show, the kind that you'll never see in a hollywood production.  Plotlines will be thinner, characters less intriguing.  Now they can write the show for its audience.  With a movie they'll have to try to expand and a much larger audience.  I'd hate to see the havoc that would create to the cerebral aspect of the show, which would probably be replaced by some over the top George Lucas CGI nonsense.</description>

					<description>You make a good pount about HBO and Showtime, Logan. Personally, I'm hoping BSG will make it to the big screen, not just television movies.... though, if they make it to Earth, that's a logical end for the all things Galactica.</description>

					<description>It is an odd move, but I'm sure they have a ton of market research to back up the move. Clearly the target demographics of BSG will be home on a Sunday night. (BSG has great demographics, but Friday is a big going out night, after all.)   Plus, HBO and Showtime have had great sucess with having their flagship shows on Sundays.



It was always risky to put BSG on in the fall up against the networks instead of during the summer.



There's no risk of cancellation.  The DVD sales alone justify at least a fourth season, and perhaps a fifth as well.  The network, studio, and producers would be smart though to announce that the show will have a certain end of all the story arcs by the end of the 5th season, much as Babylon 5 did -- while still allowing for TV movies, etc.</description>
