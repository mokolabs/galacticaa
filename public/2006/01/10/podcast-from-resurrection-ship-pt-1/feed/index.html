					<description>i liked the podcast, i am without tv signal, moving from panama to mx city, and i got to wait untill i can see the re runs of 3rd season... too bad i am so happy with the show, i like how you are focusing the power issue... how humans in ignorance before killed and abussed the cylons, then the cylons doing the same, it reminds me our little world, when firt the oppressed people make movies of how many millions where killed during wwII and now they act just like their former oppresors... it is interesting that we as humans with the little resourses that we are capable of, can spread the word non of one oppressed people, religion or political view, (getting short with my english here... im mexican... thinking in spanglish... wait...) yeap! got it, that you that are making a metaphor can talk about how we are not prepared to handle power... and probably you are not making this on porpouse, but usually happends with any play...

anyway, thks i am hopping to get the whole thing in dvd... very good sci fi program... love it</description>
