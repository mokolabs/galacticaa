					<description>I'm surprised as a BSG site you are unaware of the Enterprise in the Colonial Fleet.....Yes it is the Enterprise. It was put in the Fleet by The special effects department as an in-joke on Ron Moore, since he worked on Numerous Star Trek Series.</description>

					<description>Definitely agree on Emmy politics, sungoddess. And from what I've heard, their voting process was different this year, and perhaps partly to blame for the series of odd choices that were made (including no nods to BSG or LOST).



Again, I love both shows, but I do think LOST has better production values and more consistent story pacing than BSG.



But I really couldn't vote for one or the other... they're both awesome in their own ways.</description>

					<description>I never got into Lost... I simply don't watch television, and the couple of episodes I've seen just didn't capture my attention. Most TV is like that for me. However, BSG has always had my interest... and what I like about it is, I started watching late in Season 1, and it captured my imagination and attention immediately. I can't say that about Lost. Personally I think that the quality of BSG as a production, far outweighs anything I saw on Lost, and the fact the Emmy's shut it out for another year to me says a lot about the politics of the Emmy's. Doesn't seem to be about quality to me at all. Mary McDonnell wuz robbed!!!</description>

					<description>Well, since you run a BSG-related site, and not a &quot;Lost&quot; one, it shouldn't be too tough.</description>
