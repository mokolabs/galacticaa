					<description>Wow, the flight deck is amazing! 



I've started making some Battlestar Galactica minifigs - so far I've done Adm. Adama, insurgent Tigh, and Starbuck. Boomer is in the works (having a little trouble with her flight suit).

					<description>Great pics. I love them all. Just wanted to correct you on something. The pics are not based on the old show. It's all from the new show. The two figures on the Mark 7 are &quot;Apollo&quot; and Galen Tyrol. Right behind them on the deck floor are (from left to right) Colonel Saul Tigh, Admiral William Adama, and &quot;Starbuck&quot;. In the back of the picture between the Mark 2's, is a dark haired female piolt, probably &quot;Boomer&quot;. Keep up the good work.</description>

					<description>I was wondering you did release your instructions on how to make the Mark VII Viper (Both white &amp;#38; gray versions pictured).  This is probably the best and most durable design I have seen on the internet. (It took 23 years for Lego Star Wars to be produced and I am impatient).  I would appreciated it if you are willing to send me instructions and even the parts list.  If not, please know that your design and creation is phenominal. Thank you.</description>

					<description>Hello I was wondering if you would send me the instructions on how to make the Mark VII Viper. I think that this lego has been the best that I have ever seen in my life.  I would really like it if you could send me the instructions again and maybe even the parts list too.  Thanks I hope you can get me that stuff soon.



                                                Sincerely,

                                                Cameron</description>
